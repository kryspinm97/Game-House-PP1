## Bugs ## 

### Solved Bugs ### 

  * Navigation bar buttons were down as a ( a href ) attribute which was not up to the W3C HTML standard. Changing the navigation bar buttons into onclick to move around the page fixed the validation error.

  * When manually resizing the window the cards don't resize on contact with each other the whole time.
